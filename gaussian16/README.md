# Gaussian 16
-----

The gaussian.py file is a modified version of the gaussian.py calculator
included with ASE. It hijacks the addsec keyword for the purpose of writing
generic solvent data to the input file.

xyz2g16.py converts standard XYZ/XMOL format files to gjf input files. Example
of how to account for multiplicity is included.

Copy the python code to a local directory and modify it there, this one is
purely an example!
