# Materials database

A (not very large) collection of optimized bulk structures commonly used for 
our work. Filename gives some description of the software and theory.

Expect that the transition metals are done in VASP with PBE+U, other materials
will almost certainly have been done with CP2K. These should be taken as 
input structures for new work.

## Hubbard values

Li = 0.00 eV ```_sv```

O  = 0.00 eV ```_standard```

Ni = 6.37 eV ```_pv```
