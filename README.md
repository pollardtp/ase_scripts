[ace-pi-lot], *humor*

Python and shell source for using the atomic simulation environment (ASE) or
other tools to accomplish various tasks from converting formats to setting up
calculations.

Source is written with the following practices,

1) Python3
2) Standardized header, always checks for ASE >= 3.15.0 (ca. 2017)
3) Where reasonable, uses glob to run over all files of same type in directory
4) Halloween commit
